Final Fight is a CLI (command line interface) text-based fighting game.
Originally made as a project to practice coding, this game is inspired by pieces of interactive fiction that were popular during the late 70s and early 80s and battle royale/ arena type games. 

Final Fight is currently being refined into a much larger game with a whole new story mode, new atmosphere and slightly altered gameplay.
